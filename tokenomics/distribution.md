# CINV Token

### Description

Every day of holding a ClayInvader NFT adds extra perks which will be rewarded over time!\


### How does it work?

There is a SPACE treasury.&#x20;

We will take a snapshot of our policy ID holders every EPOCH.&#x20;

For each NFT in the wallet for the snapshot, you receive a token reward in our ClayInvaders token $CINV.&#x20;

You will be able to claim your % of ADA of the treasury in the same proportion of your $CINV/Total $CINV.&#x20;



### How much $CINV?

To benefit OG, we reward tokens in a halving style, dividing the number of tokens distributed to each EPOCH by two.&#x20;

Starting from 16 CINV until we achieve the value of 1.&#x20;

* EPOCH 368 - 16 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 369 - 8 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 370 - 4 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 371 - 2 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 372 - 1 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* FOLLOWING - 1 CINV x NFT (Until Game Launch & 2MM Supply not reached)

The CINV is attached to the NFT and will be there until it's claimed.

**Important:**\
\- You **only receive CINV** token if the NFT is **not listed** on secondary markets (jpg.store, epoch.art,  etc.)\
\- Tokens listed will **lose the accumulated $CINV** attached to the token if they are **listed** on secondary markets.
