# CINV Token

### Description

Every day of holding a ClayInvader NFT adds extra perks which will be rewarded over time!\


### How does it work?

There is a SPACE treasury.&#x20;

We will take a snapshot of our policy ID holders every EPOCH.&#x20;

For each NFT in the wallet for the snapshot, you receive a token reward in our ClayInvaders token $CINV.&#x20;

You can claim your % of ADA of the treasury in the same proportion of your $CINV/Total $CINV.&#x20;

The best part, CINV will be Claimable by ADA whenever you want and your $CINV will be burned.

### How much $CINV?

To benefit OG, we reward tokens in a halving style, dividing the number of tokens distributed to each EPOCH by two.&#x20;

Starting from 16 CINV until we achieve the value of 1.&#x20;

* EPOCH 368 - 16 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 369 - 8 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 370 - 4 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 371 - 2 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* EPOCH 372 - 1 CINV x NFT&#x20;
* FOLLOWING - 1 CINV x NFT (Until Game Launch & 2MM Supply not reached)

### Supply

The total supply of CINV will be 2MM

* 5% Founders
* 80% Holders
* 15% Game Rewards

### Sources

SPACE treasury will be composed:&#x20;

* 6% of mint sales&#x20;
* 6% of royalties (perpetual income for secondary market sales)&#x20;
* Claimed $CINV Tokens will be burned

### Transparency

The Treasury and the Royalties are Cardano addresses that you can check whenever you want.\
You will see in our first token minted (777 means royalties) the % of royalties is 12%.\
This was made intentionally:

* 6% for ClayInvaders Founders
* 6% for SPACE Treasury
