# Art Generation

One of the most common way to generate a collection is to work in traits, and assemble them algorithmically.

You don't need to create a tool from scratch to do this, here we share the changes we did to a great lib called **Hashlips Art Generation Lib**.

We adapted it to:

* Cardano Metadata
* Simplified Configuration&#x20;

So if you have the traits but don't know how to assemble them, take a look and feel free ping us!&#x20;
