# How to Play

## Description

This is a **WEB3** game that could be played at **DISCORD** and **WEB,** with seamless integration to **Cardano Wallets** and the **Blockchain.**

## DISCORD

You could use any browser wallet to integrate your DISCORD user, with the wallet where you have the NFTs.

#### WALLET <-> DISCORD Integration

To improve the User Experience, most of the actions will be performed in DISCORD.&#x20;

You need to integrate the Browser extension Wallet of your preference to the DISCORD user.&#x20;

* In DISCORD, call the game bot`/ci-game start`
* The bot asks you to open a web page&#x20;
* Select the wallet you want to integrate
* The wallet opens and you sign a message verifying that you are the owner
* You receive a message in DISCORD notifying the integration
* You are **READY to PLAY**

**Note**: This has no cost to you.

#### Spaceship Units

Each Spaceship Unit has a DISCORD channel where all action happens\
I.e. The Serenity (Unit 1) channel is #serenity-unit-1

#### Join a Unit

* Each epoch a new mission starts and the crew needs to be fulfilled
  * A notification is sent to the unit DISCORD channel
* NFT owners could join the unit using one of the following bot commands \
  `/ci-game join`\
  `/ci-game join serenity-unit-1`\
  `/ci-game join serenity-unit-1 with ClayInvader#01234`
* The bot checks the crew members in your wallet and the roles not filled
* If you don't specify the bot ask you:
  * Spaceship Unit to Join
  * NFT to use
* If all roles are fulfilled or you don't have an available role, you are going to be joined as a passenger
